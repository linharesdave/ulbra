This repository is the place where you can find a bit about me while student, tasks we are doing and all.
All activities are gonna be made in English, except by some answers or questions. If they're made in PT-BR, they're gonna be answered in PT-BR.

Before you go ahead:
If you enjoy working with Batch Scripts, take a look at my "Telecom" repository, where I've been developing some telnet/ssh and clipboard automation solutions.

Thanks for visiting this humble profile ;)
